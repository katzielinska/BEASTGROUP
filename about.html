Having a pretty busy life didn't stop me from at least trying to pursue a few minor aspects in game development with my friend of about 10 years Syax, as we started on Mandew vs UDM. I did some character and environment design work on that game, and as the projects went one I played more of a support role brainstorming and assisting in design ideas and gameplay mechanic suggestions. </p>
<p class="creator-text">
I took on the role of trying to connect with fans via twitter and other platforms such as Youtube and Deviantart in order to express a more tight nit dev-to-client environment with those enjoying Khimera: DAMG after its release on Steam. Hoping S&amp;S grows further and with it bring more opportunity for me to grow! (WOAH)"

Years ago, I made Ice Demon as an experiement to gauge my potential in game development. Now, with more interest in this hobby, I am working on Throneless in hopes of making money off of it and making my life a bit easier. More importantly, I hope to develop quality video games that make people happy. I am currently partnered with S&S which has been a big help in growing as a developer, and hopefully my products will help them grow as well. My favorite game is Kirby Superstar.”</p>

My favorite thing to draw would have to be character designs, I love any sort of concept art. With video games I love anything to do with exploring, which means of course my favorite game is Oblivion. It’s only the best game ever. Speaking of best things ever Labyrinth is my favorite movie and my entire life wow but nothing will ever top my cats. My cats are what I live for, I love them”</p>
