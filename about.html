                        <p>"I'm the big boss! I've been making video games since middle school. My hobbies include video games, carpentry, cosplay and collecting things. With my passion for video games and training in business administration and management, I hope to make S&amp;S a developer that delivers quality content while also being a positive role model for young developers everywhere. My favorite video game is StarTropics and my favorite movie is Speed Racer.</p>
                        <p>
                            My design philosophy is to make what you want to play, so if you like my games that means we must have similar tastes!"

                        <p>"I'm a nursing major who just loves videogames! I work part-time and go to school fulltime. Having a pretty busy life didn't stop me from at least trying to pursue a few minor aspects in game development with my friend of about 10 years Syax, as we started on Mandew vs UDM. I did some character and environment design work on that game, and as the projects went one I played more of a support role brainstorming and assisting in design ideas and gameplay mechanic suggestions. </p>
<p>
I took on the role of trying to connect with fans via twitter and other platforms such as Youtube and Deviantart in order to express a more tight nit dev-to-client environment with those enjoying Khimera: DAMG after its release on Steam. Hoping S&S grows further and with it bring more opportunity for me to grow! (WOAH)"
